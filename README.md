# PiRoutine | Server & Alarmclock

- Clone to your Raspberry Pi
- Connect to your Pi's mysql database
- Port Forward the Pi so it's accessible externally
- Install / set up pm2 to run `server` & `alarmclock` on startup
- Clone, Install & Deploy the PiRoutine Client & read it's README

One day, I'll make a video. Meanwhile, just ask if you'd like help setting up.
