###  PiRoutine is a morning alarm system that uses a port forwarded raspberry pi, that's wired via relay switch to a water pump, and interacted with through a deployed front end. 
 ### All of which aims to instill good habits in the user, starting by waking up on time.

###  This is done by leveraging a pavlovian fear of laying in bed too long after they've heard their external alarm go off, by soaking the user and/or their bed with water. In return, the user quickly learns to wake up alongside their external alarm, jumping out of bed, ready to start their day with a light jog!

## Raspberry Pi Installation
  The raspberry pi is connected to a water pump, stored inside the 5 gallon bucket beside the bed. The pump has tubing connecting it to a piece of conduit with holes drilled into it, attached to my headboard.

## Set Up

- Clone to your Raspberry Pi.
- Install MySQL and connect to your Pi's mysql database.
- Port Forward the Pi so it's accessible by external networks. (Cautiously)
- Install PM2 and set it up to run `server` & `alarmclock` on startup.
- Clone, Install & Deploy the PiRoutine Client & [read it's README](https://github.com/daurham/PiRoutine-EC2-Client)

One day, I'll make a video. Meanwhile, just ask if you'd like help setting up.
